Homework 6
================

## Problem 1

load in the data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
    ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_double(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Start with one city.

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Try this across cities.

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI"))
```

Plot some ORs

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Importing and tidying data

``` r
birthweight_df = 
  read_csv("birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    frace = recode(frace,
                  `1` = "White",
                  `2` = "Black",
                  `3` = "Asian",
                  `4` = "Puerto Rican",
                  `8` = "Other")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    mrace = recode(mrace,
                  `1` = "White",
                  `2` = "Black",
                  `3` = "Asian",
                  `4` = "Puerto Rican",
                  `8` = "Other")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    malform = recode(malform,
                          `0` = "absent",
                          `1` = "present")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = recode(babysex,
                     `1` = "male",
                     `2` = "female")
  ) %>% view()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
sum(is.na(birthweight_df))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
# no missing data points!!
```

Initial thoughts - not a lot of malformations, previous low birthweight
babies, or prior small for gestational age babies

Thinking of looking into:

  - gestational age (gaweeks) - this seems like it would be a highly
    predictive var given fetal development (they gain the most weight
    during the final trimester of gestation)
  - blength - a 2012
    [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22535715/#:~:text=The%20addition%20of%20fetal%20length,%25%20versus%207.5%25%3B%20P%20%3C%20.)
    by Melamed et al. found that the addition of fetal length as a
    variable significantly improved their model’s correlation with birth
    weight.
  - mrace - also correlated with access to adequate care; Black mothers
    are more likely to have preterm and low-birthweight infants
  - delwt - A 2010
    [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2974327/#:~:text=Observational%20studies%20have%20generally%20found,birth%20weight%20or%20infant%20adiposity.&text=Moreover%2C%20maternal%20adiposity%20tends%20to,BMI29%20than%20paternal%20adiposity.)
    found that maternal weight gain during pregnancy increases infant
    birthweight

Some exploration to visualize chosen vars

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gaweeks, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point()
```

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = blength, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point()
```

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mrace, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_aps2204_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-3.png" width="90%" />

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = delwt, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point()
```

Will first make the following models:

  - One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
    effects only)
  - One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
    (including the three-way interaction) between these

Lenght at birth and gestational age as predictors model

could do stepwise model building compare to one that uses length at
birth and gest age as predictors, one that contains head circumference
sex etc.

looking at prediction accuracy based on birthweight for those vars

perhaps start with those two bullet points, look at cross val lecture
and adjust code accordingly take full dataset and figreu out model u
want to propose in this context - just start picking vars and fitting
htem, looking at results to see if things are significant

big issues with dataset?

``` r
# baby_df %>% 
#   modelr::add_residuals(model_fit) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(x = gaweeks, y = resid)) +
#   geom_point()
```

## Problem 3

download dataset, fit model to dataset, make sure can compute adjusted
r-sq (comes from broom::glance), broom::tidy, estimated coefficients,
rearrange things so have intercept and slope next to each other that you
can multiply and take the log of.
